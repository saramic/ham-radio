# Hardware - Computer coupling experiments

There are classic modern ways to connect a computer or phone to some hardware:
  - USB
  - Bluetooth
  - WiFi - directly, on network or via Cloud

There are also cutting edge ways to connect
  - browser based USB and Bluetooth Serial
  - IoT usually via a gateway: LoRA, Zigbee, Matter (formerly CHIP)
  - USB HID or BLE like a crypto smart key
  - phone NFC
  - etc

And all the othe weird ways
  - phone magnetometer
  - phone vibration
  - phone charging circuit
  - phone pressure sensitivity on the screen
  - LED blinking encoded data identified by camera
  - acoustic coupling - _like swipe card readers did via an audio jack_

Below are a number of experiments to do with hardware - computer coupling

## In Progress

### FSK

[fsk](./fsk/)

A modem (modulator-demodulator) is a device that converts digital signals from
devices like computers into analog signals suitable for transmission over
channels such as telephone lines or radio waves, and vice versa. This process
involves different modulation techniques. FSK (Frequency Shift Keying) is one
such technique, but there are several others used in modems.

- **FSK** (Frequency Shift Keying): FSK encodes digital data by changing the
  frequency of a carrier signal, using different frequencies to represent binary
  digits. It is simple to implement and robust against amplitude noise, but less
  bandwidth efficient than other methods and can have frequency discontinuities.
  FSK has been used in early modems and continues in applications such as
  Bluetooth (using GFSK), wireless sensor networks, and caller ID.

- **Other Modulation Formats**: Other techniques include Amplitude Shift Keying
  (ASK), which changes amplitude; Phase Shift Keying (PSK), which changes phase;
  and Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM), which combines ASK and PSK for
  higher data rates. Each has advantages and disadvantages regarding complexity,
  efficiency, and susceptibility to noise.

- **Types of FSK and Variants**: FSK has several forms, including Binary FSK
  (BFSK) which uses two frequencies, Multiple FSK (MFSK) which uses multiple
  frequencies for higher data rates, Continuous-Phase FSK (CPFSK) with smooth
  phase transitions, and Gaussian FSK (GFSK) which uses filtering to improve
  spectral efficiency.

### DTMF

[dtmf](./dtmf/)

**DTMF** (Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency) is a signaling system used in
telecommunication (e.g., telephone keypads) where each key press generates a
combination of two specific audio frequencies‚Äîone from a low-frequency group and
one from a high-frequency group. Each digit or symbol is uniquely identified by
its pair of tones.

#### How DTMF Works

Basis: Each button on a DTMF keypad (0-9, *, #, A-D) produces two simultaneous
tones: one from a set of low frequencies (697, 770, 852, 941 Hz) and one from a
set of high frequencies (1209, 1336, 1477, 1633 Hz). Transmission: When a key is
pressed, the two corresponding frequencies are played together, allowing the
receiver to decode which key was pressed by detecting both frequencies.

#### DTMF with Electronics Hardware

**Output**: Microcontrollers can generate DTMF by outputting two sine waves
simultaneously (using PWM, DAC, or external DTMF generator ICs like the MT8870
or HT9200).

**Input**: DTMF tones can be detected using dedicated decoder ICs (like MT8870)
or by sampling audio with an ADC and performing a frequency analysis (e.g.,
Goertzel algorithm) in software.

#### DTMF in Web Pages (HTML/JS Sound APIs)

**Output**: The Web Audio API can generate two sine waves at the required DTMF
frequencies and play them together when a button is pressed on a virtual keypad.

**Input**: Using the Web Audio API and getUserMedia, you can capture microphone
input and analyze the audio stream (using FFT or Goertzel algorithm in
JavaScript) to detect which two frequencies are present, thus decoding the DTMF
key.
