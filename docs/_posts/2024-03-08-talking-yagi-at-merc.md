### Another day another Yagi

After yesterdays deep dive on Yagi calculators and my, what looks like, lob
sided yagi, it was time to put the learnings to good use, use the other
calculor and build a "better looking" Yagi. Ofcourse the proof is in how well
it works, and once I get a NanoVNA, how well it measures up. Having already
attempted a build with polyprop and tape measure I had a bunch of learnings

- cut straight, with a blade and not a saw. The saw leaves the end too rough
  and it's too hard to clean up.
- found a better way of cutting, basically clamp the blade and spin the
  plastic, this allowed for a straight cut.
- pre-measure all the separators - makes it easier to cut and it should be all
  the right distance once put together. - _but maybe fine tune it before you
  cut it? more on that later_
- take it easy with drilling the holes - still made a mess here on a couple of
  them
- file still seems the best way to take the barbs off
- use cable ties till I get a chance to tune the gap in the dipole

looks a bit better! Unfortunately still have not managed to connect it to my
radio, as even though I bought some RG58 cable, and BNC connectors and a BNC to
SMA converter, I could not seem to join the cable to the connector as the wire
was too thick. This made me more eager to go to that nights local HAM meetup
with [MERC (Melbourne Electronics and Radio Club)](https://www.vk3fsk.org.au/)
to try and sort this out. This and a question around grounding antennas for
safety from thunder storms and maybe some info about programing the Quansheng
UV-K5.

I roll up and was ready for opinions to fly high. Firstly I was accused of
buying 75â„¦ TV coax. Even when they looked at the slightly thiner RG-58/U
clearly marked as such they argued about the fact it had a solid core and it
needs a stranded core. Later that night someone more knowledgable pointed out
that RG-58/U is single solid centre conductor and RG-58C/U is stranded centre
condcutor. After I mentioned that I could not fit the core into the pin of the
connector a bunch of people suggested hacks. I guy even pulled out a pocket
knife and started filing to make it fit. Trust me buddy, I tried that at home
but you are not changing 20 AWG wire into 22 AWG wire with a file. And that is
because after finally reading the packet, my eye sight is getting so bad I will
need glasses to go to the shop for connectors, I realised I was sold RG-59 BNC
socket. RG-59 is used for TV with 75 Ohm impedence and has a thinner 22AWG
wire, henc it does not fit into the connector. Time for an exchange tomorrow.
The good thing, is that overhearing some chatter, it sounds like a bunch of
people think that BNC is a good standard for a lot of HAM gear, not as good as
N connector but pretty good. The big win for hackingtogether antennas is that
the bayonet design means easy on/off and can see it is clearly connected.

Next was the intrigue of the Yagi and what it was for. I said for chasing radio
sondes. This lead to 2 discussion. The first was about fox hunting in general.
A site I should check out is [VK3YNG Foxhunting equipment and related
files](https://foxhunt.com.au/) and in particular his [MK4 2m fox hunting
page](https://www.foxhunt.com.au/2m_sniffer/manual.htm). Here is his foxhunting
antenna design.

![](https://www.foxhunt.com.au/2m_sniffer/beam.gif)

and we get into matching. The design above actually looks pretty clear. It has
a gamma match with a balun (loop of coax) - certainly worth while if I make a
transmitting antenna. At this point we discussed how important it is to match
the antenna given it is just recieving and the guy I spoke to was adamant it
was important. Not only that, but it means I can tune my other yagi antenna as
well, you can tune anything. This was counter to what a bunch of people said
later on, saying it is not important. These contrary views is what you got to
get used to I suppose, matching vs not matching for recieve only, thich RG-58
vs thin RG-58, solder for connectors vs cimping only. In general I will always
side with the more measurable, so I will attempt to measure and match the
antenna at some stage and who knows maybe it will lead to some better results,
after all the website presented is by a fox hunting champion so it might be
worth going the extra mile.

What was also interesting was how to attenuate the signal when fox hunting.
Because the signal will get too strong when you get closer, the idea would be
to have a switch across a bunch of attenuating circuits to reduce the RF as you
get closer and prevent it from clipping, in effect allowing you to better tell
the direction and distance of the object you are fox hunting. A normal radio
also has AGC (Automatic Gain Control) which would interfer with fox hunting as
it will present the signal as always being same volume and hence looses the
ability to tell distance. We discussed some more about the [Inverse square
law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law) and how power
dissipates, although I assumed this would be more of a cube law as it goes in
all directions, still **Square law** is what is in wikipedia so let it be.

Finally conversation two, and it blew a lot of this out of the water. A guy
showed me that he had re-programmed a LilyGo T-beam 433MHz LoRa radio made for
the US to recieve AND decode the airsonde packets on 400MHz. The T-Beam has a
built in GPS so I presume this is also telling you exact location and distance.
Kind of like a thing I wanted to build, still I am keen to attempt my version
at some stage. I was thinking either SDR to RasPi, or take the audio straight
out of the UV-K5 and process it on an arduino or similar.

## Discussing SOTA

SOTA is Summits on the Air! where a summit is

> A summit (or group of summits) must be at least 300 metres above sea level
> and have 150 metres prominence from the surrounding landscape. 

[https://sotl.as/](https://sotl.as/)

Sounds like there are a bunch of summits registered around the world, if you make 4 contacts within a 24 hour UTC day, you can register that with the sota site, sort of a competition I suppose.

## Grounding antennas

I did get an answer to this, and it seems no one does anything to ground
antennas from lighting. And the only story someone had was of someone moving a
TV aerial when they got hit by lightning. So it sounds like just un-plugging it
should be enough and maybe even the wire would be destroyed before it got to
the HAM shack?

## M17 digital radio modulation mode

And just after re-listening about codec2, there is [M17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M17_(amateur_radio))

> M17 is a digital radio modulation mode developed by Wojciech Kaczmarski
> (amateur radio call sign SP5WWP) and is primarily designed for voice
> communications on the VHF amateur radio bands, and above.
>
> M17 uses Frequency-Division Multiple Access (FDMA) technology in which
> different communication streams are separated by frequency and run
> concurrently. It utilizes 4,800 symbols per second, 4-level frequency-shift
> keying (4FSK) with a root Nyquist filter applied to the bitstream.
>
> M17 uses Codec 2, a low bitrate voice codec developed by David Rowe VK5DGR

and for a rainy day I suppose I should watch some more on this
