Finally found a reasonably educational channel on YouTube with respect to
experimenting, tinkering and building -

What caught my eye was this episode
  [![
    NanoVNA and TinySA for Radio Design

which discusses the idea of building out a cheap RF lab at home which was not
possible without the advent of small cheap test equipment like the
[NanoVNA](https://nanovna.com/) and the [tinySA](https://www.tinysa.org/).

The equipment covered here is:

- TinySA - spectrum analyzer
- [FeelTech 3200s](http://en.feeltech.net/index.php?case=archive&act=show&aid=16) - audio signal generator
    - available for around $100 on Banggood, AliExpress, Amazon with AliExpress
      having a sale at $40
- DANIU ADS5012H Digital Screen Digital Oscilloscope - 500MS/s Sampling Rate
  100MHz Analog Bandwidth Support Waveform Storage - realistically good to 30MHz
  - around the $100 mark [https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001381533515.html](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001381533515.html) - _not available_
  - although there seem to be some labled just ADS5012H for under $20

  - althought in the past I beleive I was interested in an OWON
- NanoVNA  - Vector Network Analyzer
- A multimetere like - Acegmet JXM8000 - Low cost DMM Digital MultiMeter

    - UFL connectors? - https://www.digikey.com.au/en/product-highlight/h/hirose/ufl-series

Clearly a lot of stuff to look into - but first I need somem focus on what is
the first step.
