## Radiosonde tracking

What is Radiosonde? Every day, every main city sends a balloon up for weather
measurements. These balloons float around until the burst and fall to the
groud. On the ground they are fare game for anyone to grab, after all they are
a form of rubbish at that point. This sounlds like a cool idea for "fox
hunting" these transmitters.

In Melbourne it seems to be sent at 10am from the airport. As the balloon
floats up it transmits GPS and a bunch of weather data. There is site -
[https://radiosondy.info/](https://radiosondy.info/) - which tracks the signals
from the balloons, draws them on a map as well as plots the prediction of where
a balloon will fly. There is even a [leaders
board](https://radiosondy.info/user_rank.php) for those who register that they
have found such a radiosonde.

1 such radio sonde was [sondenumber:
U2840056](https://radiosondy.info/sonde.php?sondenumber=U2840056)

I found a couple of resources on tracking these radiosondes

Looking back at [sondenumber:
U2840056](https://radiosondy.info/sonde.php?sondenumber=U2840056) it says it
transmits on `400.500 MHz` (and the others in Melbourne transmit on `401.500
MHz`) so it was time to rummage about and find a receiver I may have to pick
these signals up. Finally I pulled out an old RTL-SDR USB dongle I had around,
never before connected successfully to my computer, and thought let's give it a
go. And sure enough after finding that I should use GQRX and I could install it
with brew
```
  brew cask install gqrx
```
I put an old scanner antenna on it, walked out the back and heard the
distictive sound of a Radiosonde transmission - success. Now to build a rig to
track these and actually find them.

### Radiosonde fox hunting rig

1. RTL-SDR seems a good fit
1. the GQRX software is ok
1. but I would need a more mobile rig, so I should look to switch to a RasPi
    1. with an external monintor and mount as well as power
1. it would be good to have a directional antenna, maybe a yagi
1. it would be good to also have an omni directional antenna
1. maybe an RF switch to switch between the antennas
1. maybe even an RF amplifier
1. and a GPS so I could compare where I am and the Radiosonde is. This would
   help point the directional antenna in the right direction as well as predict
   how far to walk when it has finally fallen on the ground. Maybe this is a
   smaller headsup display on an OLED.

With my head spinning with ideas I thought it would be worth investigating some of them.

**Run it on a RasPi**

I think the first next step would have to be to run it on a RasPi, make sure it compiles and is performant. That and getting the Radiosonde decoder software working to get live metrics and location from the Radiosonde.

There seem to be some good resources here
  - [https://github.com/tkerr/rpi-sdr?tab=readme-ov-file](https://github.com/tkerr/rpi-sdr?tab=readme-ov-file)
  - [https://github.com/tkerr/rpi-sdr?tab=readme-ov-file#software-needed](https://github.com/tkerr/rpi-sdr?tab=readme-ov-file#software-needed) - including how to burn the image
  - [http://www.om3bc.com/docs/SF/sondefinder_en.html](http://www.om3bc.com/docs/SF/sondefinder_en.html)

**Decoder**

Probably would be best to decode your own signals. According to [https://www.rtl-sdr.com/tutorial-on-using-rs-to-decode-and-plot-radiosondes/}(https://www.rtl-sdr.com/tutorial-on-using-rs-to-decode-and-plot-radiosondes/) **RS** is the free program of choice
- [https://github.com/rs1729/RS](https://github.com/rs1729/RS)
- there is mention of a tutorial on _https://www.happysat.nl/Zilog/decoder.html_
    - which can be accessed via way back machine
      https://web.archive.org/web/20180909213658/http://www.happysat.nl/Zilog/decoder.html
      - the images seem to be missing but there is a bunch of install
      instructions which could come in handy

**Antenna**

Next would probably be making a resonable directional antenna, like a Tapemeasure Yagi

it's time to get something like a NanoVNA? the other thing I want to
get is a TinySA Ultra! for frequency analysis! so many things, so
little money and time to sort out which to play with.

## Morse practice key

Keen to bring some of this interest into my scout troop. The idea is to bring a morse code practice key to a scout meeting. Then slowly build on the idea:
- maybe have them build their own key out of some springy steel
- build a simple transmitter
- build a transmitter over something like an ESP32 and wifi?
  - maybe using an ESP32 mesch you could have a bunch of scouts communicate together in the bush?
  - ESP32 mesh

### Center tapped transformer audio oscillator

_https://www.next.gr/circuits/CENTER-TAPPED-TRANSFORMER-AUDIO-OSCILLATOR-l53755.html_

> The oscillator circuit uses a center-tapped transistor output transformer to
> serve as a load for the collector of Q1, supply a feedback signal for the
> base, and serve as the output winding for driving the speaker. R1 supplies dc
> bias and C1 completes the ac path from the transformer to Q1's base. You can
> play around with the values of C1 and R1 to change the oscillator's output
> level and tone, but don't reduce R1's value too much or the transistor will
> draw excessive collector current.
