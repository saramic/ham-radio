Reflecting on the last time I was interested in radio, and at that time I was
listening tot he Soldresmoke podcast. 2 things stuck out for me from that
podcast, the talk of ["Experimental Methods in RF Design", Wes Hayward et
al](https://www.amazon.com.au/Experimental-Methods-Design-ARRL-Inc/dp/087259923X)
and some dude in India who had created a low cost radio based on easily
accessible parts from a television, the BITX20 built by [Ashhar
Farhan](https://www.vu2ese.com/). So after a little bit of searching I cam
across the fact that the old BITX20 had grown to be the sBITX SDR radio.

  - which links to Dean's KK4DAS site where he homebrewed his own sBITX

    ](https://kk4das.blogspot.com/2024/02/homebrew-sbitx-receiver-gound-bounce.html)
    with some discussion of the build

searching deeper on Soldersmoke, I found
[https://soldersmoke.blogspot.com/2021/05](https://soldersmoke.blogspot.com/2021/05)
which has a video that goes back to the source and Farham himself talking about
his inspirations for the `sBITX`

in this phenomenal video, Farhan, spells out the game changer that
microcontrollers are to modern electronics and HAM radio builds. I love his
embrace of the OpenSource, hackable ethos and accepting changes and advances in
technology whilst still keeping to a true, amateur build in a back yard shed.

In the video he mentions the evolution of microcontrollers controlling radios,
starting with a **Raspberry Pi Pico**

and from RasPi pico moving onto the **Teensy**

A Teensy based SDR is described here

a next step might be moving onto a RasPi with a PiHat like
Radioberry? [SDR Radioberry V2.0 b4 for RPi 4-Wireless Card Analog

10CL25](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006456715216.html)

but in this case the answer is the sBitx SDR from Farhan.

He seems to mention "the paper" a number of times, and also refers to his github

I am yet to listen in more detail to: crystal filter, thermal noise, FFT,
Specturm display, convolutional filtering
